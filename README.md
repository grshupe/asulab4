Low-Speed Aerodynamic Performance of an Eppler 212 Wing with Variable Winglet Configurations is an experimental wind-tunnel study analyzing how winglet geometry affects the lift, drag, and overall aerodynamic efficiency of a finite wing. Using the ASU USE174 low-speed wind tunnel, 27 winglet configurations were tested across two Reynolds numbers (150k and 300k) to evaluate the impact of winglet angle, length, and placement on induced drag reduction, lift-curve slope, stall behavior, and efficiency. The experiment utilized a strain-gauge force balance, pitot-static system, thermocouple measurements, and a LabVIEW DAQ to capture normal and axial forces across a full pitch-angle sweep. All aerodynamic coefficients were computed in MATLAB, incorporating corrections for gravitational bias, Sutherland’s Law for viscosity, the ideal gas law for density, and full uncertainty propagation for CL/CD, and dynamic pressure. Data processing generated lift curves, drag curves, drag polars, uncertainty-bounded performance plots, and comparisons across all winglet families. Results showed that all winglets increased lift relative to the baseline, that longer winglets produced the strongest effective-span increase, that aft-mounted winglets most effectively reduced induced drag, and that higher Reynolds numbers consistently improved performance by delaying separation and reducing viscous drag. The optimal configuration was a long, aft-mounted winglet, which produced the greatest lift improvement and the lowest induced drag without major profile-drag penalties. This project demonstrates practical aerodynamic testing, large-scale data processing, and design-driven analysis consistent with real aircraft winglet optimization workflows.
